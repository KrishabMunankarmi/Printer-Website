It has mostly made learning, information gathering, and many more things much easier and accessible so much so that multiple communities with similar interests have even collaborated together in order to bring improvements in their respective fields through the internet.<br><br> 
                    With the help of technology and internet people have even been able to grow their businesses and connect to their customers more. After the rise of e-commerce it was made much easier for entrepreneurs to conduct and manage their business and at the same time making it easier for customers to choose and find the products they are looking for.<br><br>

                    Communication is a very vital part of human life. The ways of communicating has evolved throughout history. Before, people used to write letters in order to communicate with people who were very far and unreachable. But now, we can easily communicate with people even though they live on the other side of the world using cell phones. And with even more further advancements in technology and the internet we can now communicate not only through voice but with video of the person itself, making it feel as if the person is present with you in the room. So, the improvement in communication through technology has certainly turned the world into a small village.

                <p><!--Text content of the above sub-topic-->
                    For many decades, all the documentations, letters, etc had been done either in handwritten form or with the help of typewriter which was very difficult to use. All these things had to be managed and properly stored by people manually and in hard copy. But now, all such documents can be easily created, managed, stored and even shared with the help of Computers. With the help of computers people don’t have to make handwritten documents or letters, or even bother with the burden of storing and maintaining them. And with handwritten documentations and calculations the chances of error is high, but with the technology nowadays it has been made more easier to avoid error. All of these things can be easily created, managed, stored, and accessed anytime, increasing the productivity of an individual massively and also saving time and effort.

                    When a person needs to buy something he would go to the shop and buy it from the shopkeeper, and that is how buying and selling of goods worked between customer and salesman before technological advancements. But, after the advancement of technology and everyone has got access to internet, a new method of buying and selling goods started taking pace, it is now known as e-commerce. With the help of e-commerce customers could browse any goods they want and have it delivered on their doorstep making it easy for the customer. At the same, the salesman running the e-commerce website is able to handle and manage the business more efficiently along with that there will be no further expense for extensive manpower and the communication between the customer and the salesman will be much more clearer.

                    With all this advancement in technology and the easy access to the internet all of us obviously make use of them. But, what we don’t think about is about our privacy online. Whenever we visit a website we leave a digital footprint behind, and hackers and scammers take full advantage of that and strike us in our most vulnerable position for their financial gain. That is why we must always be careful while browsing through the internet. We must also always use secure and different passwords for each of the services we use on the internet. Along with that, we must never share our personal data and information with anyone even though they are our closed ones. Although there are many ways to prevent for hackers and scammers to steal our data and information, we must always stay vigilant and cautious while surfing through the internet.
